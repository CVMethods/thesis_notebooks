We especially recall Gabor's filter theory and properties by showing how these filters are related to Heisneberg's uncertainty principle.\n",

These two representations are of special interest because we can go from one to the other via the Fourier transform (or the inverse Fourier transform); therefore, these two representations carry the same signal information but in different ways.

    "The uncertainty principle is one of the most famous ideas in quantum mechanics. An early incarnation of the uncertainty principle appeared in a 1927 paper by the German physicist Heisenberg. The uncertainty principle says that we cannot measure the position $(x)$ and the momentum $(p)$ of a particle with absolute precision. The more accurately we know one of these values, the less accurately we know the other. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, the uncertainty principle in the field of quantum mechanics is just a particular case of a more general compromise that appears in simple phenomena of everyday life involving waves. The central idea is connected with the interrelation between frequency and duration. For example, in the case of sound waves, if we want to identify the frequency of a musical note, the shorter the sound lasts in time, the less certain we can be about the exact frequency of the sound; to find a more defined frequency, it would be necessary to listen to the sound for a longer time. In the language of signal processing, we can say that a short signal correlates highly with a wide range of frequencies and only wide signals correlate with a short range of frequencies. Formally this is expressed as\n",

    "Frequency is a simple waveform in the time domain, but to be sharply defined in the frequency domain it must be infinite in the time domain; a waveform always existed and remains forever. In everyday life it is very difficult to find phenomena with these characteristics, it is more common to find signals that have properties from both domains; certainly they have some frequency characteristics, but they also have a starting point and after some time these signals begin to fade away. This was the motivation of Dennis Gabor to represent signals simultaneously in time and frequency through the Gabor Elementary Function (GEF) \\cite{Gabor:JIEE:1946a}. The function represents the minimal quantum of information, that is, it occupies the minimal area, a rectangle, in the time-frequency plane; the minimal amount of simultaneous information in time and frequency.  \n",

Another parameter that we can omit is the phase shift $\\phi$. There is no evidence that any specific phase would be more beneficial than any other.

    "Our main interest in Gabor filters is multispectral analysis of a function. To accomplish this, we can generate a bank containing different Gabor functions that work at different frequencies $f$. We can define the separation of the filters in octaves by means of the half-response spatial frequency bandwidth $B_f$ measured between two central frequencies $f_1 < f_2$ \\cite{Granlund:CGIP:1978}  \n",

    "The octave spacing between two different two adjacent filters is an interesting property of the Gabor filters, however, the filters denoted by the equations \\eqref{eq:gabor_function_1d_timefreq_normalized} have a spread that only depends on the parameter $\\alpha$, regardless of its central frequency $f$. This means that when implementing the Gabor function in a filter bank at different frequencies to obtain a multi-spectral decomposition of a signal, all of the filters will have the same duration. We can see this effect in Figure \\ref{fig:filterbnk_octave_spacing}, where we show a filter bank with an adjacent filter's spacing of one octave, that is, $B_f = 1$. \n",

    "The fact that the bank filters have the same width at all frequencies is not a problem nor is it a requirement to analyze a signal with the Gabor function, however, making the filter width dependent on its frequency implies a multi-resolution analysis, since the filters behave like a scaled version of each other. One way to accomplish this, is to have the same relative window size in relation to the central frequency $f$. We must remember that window size of a Gabor function is denoted by the effective width of a Gaussian function, which in the time domain has a form of\n",

    "Since the center frequencies of the bank filters are chosen to have a constant separation between them and the effective width of the window is a function of this central frequency, there is a point on the frequency axis where two adjacent functions intersect. In a filter bank with two functions with central frequencies $f_1$ and $f_2$, the low cut-off frequency of the function at $f_1$ coincides with the high cut-off frequency of the function at $f_2$. Normally in the literature this crossing point $c_1$, corresponds to the points where the Gabor function has decreased half of its maximum value, i.e., $c_1= 1/2=0.5$ \\cite{Granlund:CGIP:1978}. However, we can obtain this crossing point $c_1$ by defining a frequency interval $\\Delta f$ that represents the distance between the points where the function $G(\\upsilon)$ begins to decrease, therefore, evaluating Eq. \\eqref{eq:1d_gaussian_function_freq} at $\\upsilon = f + \\frac{\\Delta f}{2}$\n",

To obtain a more encompassing filter bank, it is evident that we need to include a relationship between the sharpness of the Gaussian window and the central frequency. \n",

    "The sharpness of the Gaussian function, unlike the 1-d case, now includes two variables ($\\alpha, \\beta$) that affect the effective width of the Gabor filter envelope.

    "The analysis of the frequency separation in octaves between adjacent filters of a bank carried out in the Section \\ref{subsec:frequency_filter_spacing} is valid in the 2-d case. The full bandwidth of half the frequency response, $B_f$, represents the separation between the center frequencies; the interval $\\Delta f$ represents the distance between the points where $G(u, v)$ begins to decrease and; the full frequency bandwidth through the ratio $\\gamma$ and the crossing point $c_1$ allows adapting the size of the major axis of the envelope $\\alpha$ depending on the center frequency $f$.\n",

This angular bandwidth can be defined by the number of orientations $N$ in the filter bank such that $B_{\\theta} = \\frac{\\pi}{N}$.
