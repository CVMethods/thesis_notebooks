We use the theory developed in Chapter 3 about Gabor functions to extract local texture features of a color image. The main strategy consist on from transforming the input image from a three-channel real color space into a two-channel complex color representation. Then, we use a bank of Gabor filters on each channel of the image to extract the texture information generated by the variations of color and illumination in the image.\n"

    "Gabor filters have long been used for analyzing textures and extracting corresponding image features. Its adaptability and customization depending on the application and the relationship with the human visual system, have made this technique one of the most relevant for the analysis of textures in an image.\n",
    "Some of the most recognized works in literature date back to the late 90s, where this technique was a hot research topic for image texture analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of Gabor filters for image texture analysis is highly dependent on the final application. However, regarding the works present in the literature, we can make a clear separation taking into account the nature of the extracted features. The first group uses Gabor filters to extract a global texture descriptor (Gabor signature). Generally this strategy is suitable for applications where the images contain homogeneous textures and it is sought to make the the classification of images or an image retrieval system based on the content, as we can see in Chapter \\ref{ch:distance_between_distributions}. The second group is characterized by using Gabor filters to obtain local texture features present in an image. Such a strategy is suitable for image segmentation tasks. In this chapter we address in a detailed and comprehensive way the second case, delving into the spectral decomposition of color images to obtain texture features generated by the changes in illumination and/or color.\n",
    "\n",
    "In both aforementioned cases of use, we take advantage of the Gabor function's dual-domain (spatial and frequency) representation capability to create a bank of filters $\\{g_{f, \\theta}(x, y) \\}$ that works at different central frequencies $f$ (scales) and orientations $\\theta$ to obtain the spectral decomposition of an input image $I(x, y)$ through the convolution operation of each of the filters. \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:gabor_responses}\n",
    "    r_{f, \\theta}(x,y) = I(x, y) \\ast g_{f, \\theta}(x,y)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "As we know, due to the complex form of Gabor's filters \\ref{eq:gabor_function_2d_spacefreq_bank} defined in the chapter \\ref{ch:gabor_filter_description}, the response of the filter $r_{f,\\theta} (x, y)$ will have, in the same way as the filter, a real part and an imaginary part defined as $\\mathcal{R}(r_ {f, \\ theta}(x, y))$ $\\mathcal{I}(r_{f, \\theta} (x, y))$, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "The linear transformation of an image using Eq. \\eqref{eq:gabor_responses}, produces considerable information about the textures present in the image. The efficient manipulation of this information is the basis for the extraction of appropriate (local or global) texture features. Although this manipulation is a common denominator in techniques based on signal processing, in the literature we can find various schemes to create more separable texture features. In general, these methods can be classified according to the considered output and the post-processing of the Gabor filter outputs as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{enumerate}\n",
    "    \\item Using the amplitude of the response (magnitude or Gabor energy) \\cite{Bovik.Clark.ea:TPAMI:1990}\n",
    "    \\item Using the phase of the response \\cite{Palm.Lehmann:MGV:2002}\n",
    "    \\item Using only the real component of the response \\cite{Jain.Farrokhnia:IJPR:1991}\n",
    "    \\item Using the square amplitude of the response (Gabor local power)\n",
    "    \\item Using non-linear response rectification \\cite{Jain.Farrokhnia:IJPR:1991}\n",
    "\\end{enumerate}\n",
    "\n",
    "After selecting the type of output, the most common post-processing of the Gabor filter outputs in the literature consists of applying a non-linear transformation followed by smoothing using a rectangular or Gaussian window \\cite{Randen.Husoy:TPAMI:1999}, \\cite{Clausi.EdJernigan:JPR:2000}. The application of non-linearity favors the activation of the textured areas in the images, while the smoothing favors the location of the energy obtained with the filter, avoiding the loss of information from the natural contours of the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "This methodology has been used extensively in the literature to analyze images with grayscale textures. Multi-band analysis generates monochrome features that give good results. This scheme can be extended to color images considering two possible scenarios: the first consists of transforming the color image into a grayscale image, while the second consists of obtaining the features described by Eq. independently for each color band of the image, thus generating unichrome features of the color image.\n",

    "Obtaining Gabor decomposition-based texture measurements is a long-used technique for grayscale images. This scheme can be extended to color images considering two possible scenarios: the first consists in transforming the color image into a grayscale image; the second is to obtain the features described by Eq. for each color band of the image, thus generating unichromatic feautres of the color image. Despite giving good results on grayscale images, the first option is not entirely convenient because the textures in a color image can be generated by illumination variations but also by variations in chromaticity. For the second option, if we consider that the image is represented in the RGB color space, the unichrome RGB features do not utilize the correlation between the\n",
    "color bands.\n",
    "\n",
    "We believe that this strategy does not fully describe the textures of a color image. When going from a color image to a gray-scale image, the textures generated by the color changes are minimized or lost in the worst case. We then propose to analyze the textures of an image from the spectral decomposition of the channels of a color image. Such an analysis could be performed with the image represented in some classic color space such as RGB or HSV. However, we have found that the analysis of the texture per channel in any of these color spaces does not really reflect the textures generated by the color changes. To illustrate this effect, imagine an image that contains a vertical texture generated from the variation between the pure colors red, green, and blue (RGB).\n",
