    "In this chapter we present the spectral decomposition of a color image by means of the Gabor filter. We use the theory developed in Chapter 3 about Gabor functions to extract local texture features of a color image. The main strategy consist on from transforming the input image from a three-channel real color space into a two-channel complex color representation. Then, we use a bank of Gabor filters on each channel of the image to extract the texture information generated by the variations of color of the image.\n"

    "Gabor filters have long been used for analyzing textures and extracting corresponding image features. Its adaptability and customization depending on the application and the relationship with the human visual system, have made this technique one of the most relevant for the analysis of textures in an image.\n",
    "Some of the most recognized works in literature date back to the 1920s, where this technique for analyzing texture in an image was a hot research topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most widely used strategy for rendering textures with Gabor's filters is to analyze the image with a series of filters. In the case of color images, this should generally be transformed to a gray scale to reduce dimensionality. Despite giving good results, this technique is not entirely convenient because it is well known that the textures in a color image can be generated by illumination variations but also by variations in chromaticity.\n",
    "\n",
    "We believe that this strategy does not fully describe the textures of a color image. When going from a color image to a gray-scale image, the textures generated by the color changes are minimized or lost in the worst case. We then propose to analyze the textures of an image from the spectral decomposition of the channels of a color image. Such an analysis could be performed with the image represented in some classic color space such as RGB or HSV. However, we have found that the analysis of the texture per channel in any of these color spaces does not really reflect the textures generated by the color changes. To illustrate this effect, imagine an image that contains a vertical texture generated from the variation between the pure colors red, green, and blue (RGB)."
